# SQLStarterPack

GIT Repo highlighting my SQL skills. 

Starting at the basicsql.sql, I'm creating a fictional loans database. This contains a number of the basic operations in sql. 
The sqlqueries.sql file builds on the the basicsql and includes questions and how to do a query that finds the answer.  

I will also include files of the resulting databases. 

These queries were tested in postgresql 16.
